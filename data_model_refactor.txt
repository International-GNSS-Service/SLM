After consideration its been decided that the historical edit record maintained
in the data model is too complex for almost no real gain and its performance
impacts have driven some de-normalization which is bad.

Proposed changes:

    Sections:

         Published will remain a date but when a section
         is published the previous published table row shall be deleted.

         Only two rows per section per site are present at any given time. The
         updated (unpublished) row and the published row.

        Subsections:

             Only two rows per section per site per subsection identifier are
             present at any given time. The updated (unpublished) row and the
             published row.

    SiteIndex:

        All site filtering will be re-normalized from the SiteIndex based
        queries and all section information fields will be removed.

        The SiteIndex will primarily be used to access serialized log archives
        and also to determine published/decommission dates.

    Deletions, once published will be real deletions.


Query Types:
    - All
    - At-epoch
    - In range
