Pathway to NORMALIZE the data:

* published & removed timestamps on all sections.
  * For edit head published = null
  * Eliminates maximum subquery
  * Eliminates subsection issues
    * is this more efficient though than a 2-round -
      get all unique subsection IDs, then get most recent edits less than or
      equal to blah? - yes it does because you can't say more recent edits
      less than or equal to blah for each subsection id
